## SSH and FTP attacks ##
Scripts to automate attacks against the metasploitable VM!
ssh_login automatically logs into the machine through the open SSH port (22) and then executes the ls and ps commands on the VM.
brute_ssh takes a list of potentially passwords (from passwords.txt) and attempts to connect to the metasploitable vm using them. Once it has the correct password the script runs a command on the target machine.
anon_ftp attempts to login to the target machine using anonymous ftp.
