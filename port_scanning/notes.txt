## Port and Vulnerability Scanning ##
Using nmap to check for open ports and potentially vulnerable software.
SOCK_STREAM = TCP packets
The simple port scanner (simplescan.py) takes some user input (host IP) and scans a range of ports defined in the code (1-150).
The more advanced port scanner (advancedscan.py) takes more user input - host IP/domain name and the ports you wish to scan as parameters when running the script.
The Vulnerability scanner checks for specific vulnerabilities on a target IP range, searching against the entries in the vulbanners.txt file.
